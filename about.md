#### We're a designer and a developer who left their 9-to-5 jobs and started working while traveling.


We're Jad and Nicole, we're originally from Beirut, Lebanon.

Jad is a web developer and Nicole is a web designer (yes, we complete eachother). In April 2016, we quit our 9-to-5 jobs and decided to work while traveling.

### How we make money
We both teach development and design at Le Wagon, a coding bootcamp that teaches web development in 9 weeks.

We travel to Amsterdam, Brussels, Copenhagen, Barcelona, London to teach international students.

We're also both international conference speakers, we like traveling around the globe to inspire developers and designers by speaking about advanced topics.
